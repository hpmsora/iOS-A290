When I press the button the first The all label change to
"Toches ---"
"taps ---"
"deteched ---"
Then the program counts the proper amount of clicking or
returning proper location information. Also if I drag,
it shows moved.

Also if I hold option key when I am clikcing, the small gray
circle show up and draw another identical circle shows opposite
side via center point of the window.

Command-shift-H went back to home screen. And when I reopen
the app, I can see the app stil saved and working pretty well.
