First Eight Weeks Final Project Description

My idea for my final project is an app that replicates a
popular game called Cookie Clicker and it's million clones.

For the description of the final project, I'll say the item
that is being collected is cookies.

The user starts out with a cooke score of one.  As the tap the screen,
the cookie score goes up by one.  Eventually the user is able to access
an "Upgrades" menu on a second tab.  Here the user is able to spend
their cookies for upgrades which will automatically add to the score count
every set number of seconds.  For this project, I will only incorporate
the first few upgrades are so.

The project will run on two major factors: input from the user and score
added based on the number of upgrades own vs time.  Time will obviously
be a major variable in this game.
