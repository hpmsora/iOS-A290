-----------------------------

Clicker App is still the current name

I implemented the settings bundle and the persistant data storage.  I then helped finish up the main view which
my partner spend the majority of his time on.

We made it so the settings bundle allows us to change which Unit is being counted in the app

Second part of the assignment we added the major function for upgrade and output on the lable.

Also we made some development page to show who made this application.
